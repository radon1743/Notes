### [[IFS]] Methodology

1) Initiate Project 
	- Plan and prepare 
2) Confirm Prototype 
	- Documentation, Building prototype, refine scope solution 
3) Establish Solution 
	- plan for solution from reports, data and training And test for the same
4) Implement Solution 
	- implement actual solution, test the operational readiness, end user training. 
	- Change management ?
5) GO live 
	- Running and operational support 
Close project 


### [[IFS]] Implementation 
1. Define scope and project : baseline of the solution, project and services.
2. Initiate plan and prepare 
3. Confirm prototype so it fulfils the customer requirements, even the prototype will be the basis of Final solution 
4. Establish Application and make sure the application in withing the scope and agreed requirement 
5. Implement : prepare the organisation, cut over and operational readiness, and go live
6. Go live: Put solution to working and give operational support


### Scope Tool
A tool used to map the solution by modelling business processes down to scenario level.
Use of scope tool
- Define requirements
- Map out solutions
- Client and IFS team can collaborate 
- Uses 2c8 modelling tool 
- Model business process 
- **Visulize Scope**

### **Levels**
1. Main level (1 digit =  7)
2. Process level (2 digits = 7.1)
3. Sub-Process level (3 digits = 7.1.2)
4. Scenario level (4 digits = 7.1.2.4)

##### Example p2p 

Main level 
	Procurement
Process level
	PO request 
Sub-Process Level
	Handle PO request
Scenario Level
	Normal PO req
	Express PO req
	Delayed PO req
