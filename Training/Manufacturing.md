Manufacturing is a process through which a business will make its products, the following factors determine the type of manufacturing.

- Market demands
- Availability of the raw materials
- State of raw material

### Types of Manufacturing

1) Repetitive manufacturing
	- Repeating production 
	- Rate of production can be increased or decreased as required
	- Produces same or similar products
	- Assembly and production lines
	- eg pens, electronic items

2) Discrete manufacturing 
	- Similar to repetitive but more customisation
	- Process type is diverse 
	- variety of changes and frequent changes
	- Altering setup and more production type
	- In theory the products are recyclable 
	- eg furniture, mobile, air-planes, cars 
	- Bills of Material BOM

3) Job Shop Manufacturing
	- Custom products 
	- High variety products 
	- Low volume or batches used 
	- Uses production area rather than assembly line
	- eg custom machinery, specialised parts

4) Continuous process manufacturing 
	- Non-stop production even 24/7
	- continuous movement no start or stop
	- can't easily trace individual products
	- High automation
	- eg Metal smelting, oil refining, even some food production

5) Process Manufacturing 
	- Mixes batch process and continuous process 
	- Raw materials are similar 
	- output might differ 
	- By nature it is continuous in nature 
	- Output is measured in weight or volume instead of units 
	- eg Chemicals, paints, food and beverages.

### Business model

1) **MTO**:  Make to Order 
Make order when customer orders the product
2) **MTS**: Make to Stock
Make order before the customer orders the product
3) **ATO**: Assemble to Order
make Assemblies of product but join it later after order
4) **ETO**: Engineer to Order
Make product from scratch
5) **CTO**: Configure to Order
