## Quality Assurance
- A process oriented activity which focuses on ensuring that proper methods, standards and procedures are followed during SDLC
- A part of quality management which ensures the quality of the product
- This ensures the product of service will fulfil a set of quality  
- This is done before quality control 
- A part of [[SDLC]] 
- Thus this is responsibility of all the members




## Quality Control 
- A product oriented activity focused on ensuring that the developed software meets the requirement of the user.
-  Only testing team is responsible 
- A part of [[STLC]]
- Done after QA
- Small subset of quality control 

## Testing
- A subset of QC that involves executing the software to identify defects

### Principles of software QA
- Prevention over detection 
- Continuous Development
- Process oriented approach 
- Customer focus
- Early involvement 
- Facts based decision making 

1) Testing presence defects and not about absence of bugs
2) Exhaustive testing is not possible (Bugs will always exist) 
3) Early Testing (Defects which are detected early are less costly)
4) A small module might have large number of bugs (80 % of bugs are in 20% code)
5) Use new test cases to find new bugs 
6) Testing is context depended (So different type of software require different testing )
7) Absence of errors fallacy, If the software is 99% bug free but unusable then it is not useful
