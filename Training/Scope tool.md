Scope tool is used from early sales to solution building. It is easy to share and helpful in prototyping. Thus used in [[IFS Implementation Methodology]]


### Purpose
Quickly frame and visualise Solution Scope

	To derive a common understanding of the scope between us and the customer and control the scope

### Needs for scope tool
### sales 
- Describe customer unique solution 
- What process and scenarios are included in the delivery 
- calculate project
- Easy transition from sales to Project

### project
- quick prototype approach
- Speed up work, testing,data migration, solution verification
- Controls delivery and progress report 
- reuse of knowledge
### Benefits 
- Quick project Calculation 
- Easy sales to project development 
- Quick prototype for solution verification
- Scope change control using HTML
- Base for progress tracking 
- Efficient development of Training Material 
- Enabler for Industry accelerators (Efficiency and quality)


We can add prospect for new company projects or Projects for existing companies. 
- Employees have ability to add members in the project
- Partners can see and open solution editor of a project
- Customers can only see the project

### **Levels**
1. Main level (1 digit =  7) (Solution Area Model)
2. Process level (2 digits = 7.1) (area with process) 
3. Sub-Process level (3 digits = 7.1.2) (contains sub process)
4. Scenario level (4 digits = 7.1.2.4)

### Pre-burner 
A tool used by pre-sale team to build solutions fast, it is a tool in scope tool. It is a excel based tool which can be converted to CSV files and later to scope tool 

CRIM objects 
 - Configuration 
	- Non- invasive methods which exploits existing parameters to fit the customer's specific needs
	-  No code required
	- low risk, faster, cost efficient 
	- eg Personalizing the ui, creating and altering the user fields
- Reports
	- Robust reporting and analytical process to provide users with business critical data
	- The collected data can be used in tools like Power BI 
	- eg. process related reports, SQL statements, tool for creating and modifying operational reports
- Interface 
	- UI and integration capabilities that allow system to connect 
	- IFS Aurena, IFS connects, APIs
- Modification 
	- Changing the underlying software code to introduce new and unique functionalities. 
	- High risk, complex process, separate layer from source code, Using tools like IFS Developer Studio.




A tool used to map the solution by modelling business processes down to scenario level.
Use of scope tool
- Define requirements
- Map out solutions
- Client and IFS team can collaborate 
- Uses 2c8 modelling tool 
- Model business process 
- **Visulize Scope**
