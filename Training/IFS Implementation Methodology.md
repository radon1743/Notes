### [[IFS]] Methodology

The Philosophy followed in the IFS Implementation is **RAPID PROTOTYPING**

1) Initiate Project 
	- Plan and prepare 
2) Confirm Prototype 
	- Documentation, Building prototype, refine scope solution 
3) Establish Solution 
	- plan for solution from reports, data and training And test for the same
4) Implement Solution 
	- implement actual solution, test the operational readiness, end user training. 
	- Change management ?
5) GO live 
	- Running and operational support 
Close project

### [[IFS]] Implementation 
1. Define scope and project : baseline of the solution, project and services.
2. Initiate plan and prepare 
3. Confirm prototype so it fulfils the customer requirements, even the prototype will be the basis of Final solution 
4. Establish Application and make sure the application in withing the scope and agreed requirement 
5. Implement : prepare the organisation, cut over and operational readiness, and go live
6. Go live: Put solution to working and give operational support



why Erp fails?
- Failed to deliver ROI 
- Longer than expected 
- Budget 
- worker and executive are unsatisfied

Early protoype 
- early identification of gaps
- quick proof of concept 
- bring customer project team to speed up



#### IFS Application Tower 
these are main functional blocks of Applications 10
These integrated modules each represent a a business area 
-  IFS Finance : Accounting, cash flow, planning,
- IFS HCM: HR, Pay Roll, training
- IFS Project: Manage project life cycle, budgeting, forecasting
- IFS Manufacturing: Plan, execute and control Production
- IFS Supply Chain: Procurement, shipping, warehouse, inventory
- IFS Engineering: Product design, asset design, change management
- IFS Maintenance: Preventive and corrective Maintenance
- IFS Sales and Service: CRM, contracts, service scheduling

**ALL are connected to cross functional components and a shared foundation layer** 

#### Foundation Layer 
- Base for all components
- Integration tools for customisation 
- IFS Aurena and Lobbies for data interpretation 

#### Cross functional Components 
1. Document Management: for centralised document management and version control
2. Reporting and Analysis: BI, Power BI, Excel, 
3. Quality management
4. Sustainability Management: Env and compliance reporting 
5. Life-cycle Management: Manage product 
6. IOT business Connector 
7. Enterprise Operational Intelligence
8. Process models: Visualise process models
9. Accounting Rules: Consistence Model rules 

### Key features 
- one database, one ui and consistent rules
- Global readiness
- Flexible architecture 
- Visual and user friendly 
- Works with external APIs, IoT connectors, reporting interfaces
