### [[IFS]] Methodology

The Philosophy followed in the IFS Implementation is **RAPID PROTOTYPING**

1) Initiate Project 
	- Plan and prepare 
2) Confirm Prototype 
	- Documentation, Building prototype, refine scope solution 
3) Establish Solution 
	- plan for solution from reports, data and training And test for the same
4) Implement Solution 
	- implement actual solution, test the operational readiness, end user training. 
	- Change management ?
5) GO live 
	- Running and operational support 
Close project

### [[IFS]] Implementation 
1. Define scope and project : baseline of the solution, project and services.
2. Initiate plan and prepare 
3. Confirm prototype so it fulfils the customer requirements, even the prototype will be the basis of Final solution 
4. Establish Application and make sure the application in withing the scope and agreed requirement 
5. Implement : prepare the organisation, cut over and operational readiness, and go live
6. Go live: Put solution to working and give operational support



why Erp fails?
- Failed to deliver ROI 
- Longer than expected 
- Budget 
- worker and executive are unsatisfied

Early protoype 
- early identification of gaps
- quick proof of concept 
- bring customer project team to speed up
-
